# OEMetadata Schema

## From Original

Downloaded documents from https://openenergyplatform.github.io/oemetadata/latest/oemetadata/ on Feb 26, 2025.  This project is in active development so they might be out of date soon.

* schema.json contains the complete metadata schema. [Original link](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/production/oemetadata/latest/schema.json)
* [metadata_key_description.md](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/oemetadata/latest/oemetadata/metadata_key_description/) contains a full description of each metadata key.  (Their display is very nice, so I did not download it.)
* template.json contains an empty metadata string with all fields. [Original link](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/production/oemetadata/latest/template.json)
* [Crosswalks and mappings](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/oemetadata/latest/oemetadata/metadata_mappings/) to DCAT!

To use all the fields effectively, you will also need the [Open Energy Ontology](https://openenergyplatform.org/viewer/oeo/). This is also available via [The Terminology Service](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/oeo)

## Examples

* test_oemetadata.json: Describing `capacity.csv` like tried with Frictionless code, but this was done by hand to start with.
